* Meta and Command
Currently, I use Option as Meta and Command as Hyper.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)
(setq mac-command-modifier 'hyper)
#+END_SRC

This causes some thumb pain at times, as I use Meta much more often than Hyper.
However using Command as Hyper causes various issues with my macOS keybindings
(including those from third party tools). I can swap these at any time however.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mac-switch-meta nil
  "Switch Meta between Option and Command"
  (interactive)
  (if (equal mac-option-modifier 'hyper)
      (progn (setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)
             (setq mac-command-modifier 'hyper))
    (progn (setq mac-option-modifier 'hyper)
           (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta))))
#+END_SRC
* Keybindings
I prefer various bindings to work the same in Emacs as commonly in macOS apps. I
no longer rely on these bindings, but they remain convenient on occasion.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes

This contains utility functions that these keys may be bound to
